# FireDetectionOptimalColorspace
In this project, we have impleted a lightweight fire detection by transforming it to an optimal colorspace. The method detects fire at very early stages with less memory utilization. The optimal colorspace is obtained using Fuzzy-C-Means clustering and particle swarm optimization. Otsu's thresholding is applied on the new colorspace to identify the color pixels.
